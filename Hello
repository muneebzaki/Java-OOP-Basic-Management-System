Certainly! Below are the JavaDoc-style comments that can be included in your C++ code for Doxygen documentation. These comments provide detailed descriptions of your `Trie` and `TrieNode` classes and their methods.

### TrieNode Class Documentation
 
```cpp
/**
 * @class TrieNode
 * @brief Represents a node in the Trie.
 *
 * Each node contains an array of child nodes representing each letter of the English alphabet,
 * and a boolean to indicate if the end of a word is reached.
 */
```

### TrieNode Constructor

```cpp
/**
 * @brief Constructor for TrieNode.
 * Initializes all children to nullptr and isEndOfWord to false.
 */
```

### TrieNode Destructor

```cpp
/**
 * @brief Destructor for TrieNode.
 * Recursively deletes all allocated children to prevent memory leaks.
 */
```

### Trie Class Documentation

```cpp
/**
 * @class Trie
 * @brief Represents the Trie data structure for storing strings.
 *
 * Provides methods for inserting words, searching for words, and finding words with a given prefix.
 */
```

### Trie Constructor

```cpp
/**
 * @brief Constructor for Trie.
 * Initializes the root node of the Trie.
 */
```

### Trie Destructor

```cpp
/**
 * @brief Destructor for Trie.
 * Ensures all dynamically allocated nodes are properly deleted.
 */
```

### Trie Insert Method

```cpp
/**
 * @brief Inserts a word into the Trie.
 * @param word The word to insert into the Trie.
 */
```

### Trie Search Method

```cpp
/**
 * @brief Searches for a word in the Trie.
 * @param word The word to search for.
 * @return True if the word exists in the Trie, false otherwise.
 */
```

### Trie FindWordsWithPrefix Method

```cpp
/**
 * @brief Finds all words in the Trie that start with the given prefix.
 * @param prefix The prefix to search for.
 * @return Vector of strings containing all words starting with the prefix.
 */
```

### Private Trie Method findAllWords Documentation

```cpp
/**
 * @brief Recursively find all words in the Trie that begin with the given prefix.
 * @param node Current Trie node.
 * @param prefix Current prefix formed by traversing to this node.
 * @param words Vector to store the words found.
 */
```

These comments provide a clear overview of the functionality provided by each class and method, which will be useful for anyone who needs to understand, use, or modify the code in the future. This form of documentation also facilitates the generation of detailed API documentation using Doxygen.
